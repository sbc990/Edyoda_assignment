==> ASSIGNMENT 3 <==

Approach =>

First we will check the port status using following command:
cmd: - sudo netstat -tulpn | grep LISTEN

Then using following command we will check if the port is already listening, then we will check the services whether it is on ClusterIP or NodePort.
cmd: - kubectl get svc

If it is ClusterIP, then we will change it to NodePort using following command 
cmd: - kubectl edit service #servicename

Even after changing the type of Service if it is not working then we delete all the old pods and services and apply the replicaSet.yaml
so that it will create the services again, for that use following command.
cmd: - kubectl apply -f replicaSet.yaml

Now we will try to run the application, if it fails to run again then the last option is to change the port in replicaSet.yaml
